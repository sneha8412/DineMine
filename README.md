###Dinemine 
   is a multi-page web-app 

There are two aspects of this app -

1) **Hosting-**  Allows a person with a talent for cooking and a space for hosting guests, to register on the app as a host and sell their unique dining experiences. As the pandemic hit, many restaurants also closed and there might be many people who might want to use their skills and run a small business. This app will allow them to do that.
The host will be able to create a hosting account
Create experiences with multiple image upload
Update and Delete an experience if required 

2) **Customers** - As a user, there have been many times where I have craved for authentic Indian food and I know there are such amazing homechefs who can cook amazing dishes, if only I had access to them. Now with Dinemine one can experience cuisines from all over the globe in one's vicinity. Especially when traveling to an area where there are not many places that offera particular kind of cuisine, you never know there might just be a dinemine host that is hosting a great experience.
